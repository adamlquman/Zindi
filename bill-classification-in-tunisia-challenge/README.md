### The goal of the competition
<p>
Expensya is a Cloud based multi-platform expense management software. The web and mobile solution covers the entire travel and expense journey: before, during and after each business trip.

One of the main features of Expensya is the automatic extraction of information out of the receipts. Currently, this is done with OCR+. With the emergence of relevant deep learning techniques, Expensya would like to explore the performance of Deep Learning to improve one of the main features of the application, which is the automatic classification of the receipts into different categories, right after snapping a picture of the receipt.

The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to classify images of receipts by the category of the expense
