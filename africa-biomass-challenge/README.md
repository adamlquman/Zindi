### The goal of the competition
<p>
Cocoa farming has driven massive deforestation in West Africa: Cote d’Ivoire, the world’s leading exporter, has seen a loss of 80% of its forests since its independence in 1960. While cocoa is traditionally grown in monoculture, it can thrive under the shade of tall trees. To restore some of the lost tree cover, the planting of shade trees is a high priority for the country as well as the private sector, to reverse the impacts of deforestation and improve carbon sequestration by African tropical forests.

In this challenge, the objective is to predict biomass in shaded regions in Cote d’Ivoire based on GEDI, Sentinel-2 and ground truth biomass data. Remote monitoring of the increase of biomass will help measure the impact of reforestation efforts in Cote d’Ivoire as well as detect degradation of forests due to cocoa, without requiring expensive and labor-intensive biomass estimates on the ground.
