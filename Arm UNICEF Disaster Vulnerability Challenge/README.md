<h1><b></b>Description</h1>
<p>The people of Malawi have experienced an array of natural disasters and climatic shocks in recent years, including droughts, floods and landslides. The economic impacts of these disasters, coupled with Covid-19 and other global issues, negatively affect the health and wellbeing of most Malawians. People living in rural areas (more than 80% of Malawians) have been hit hardest.

There have been great strides in mapping flood extents and corresponding damages caused by these floods around the world, using satellite imagery. However, there are still gaps in determining the real number of affected populations, especially in rural areas in Malawi. Many houses in rural areas are often constructed with traditional grass-thatched roofs, and these are missed by the algorithms using satellite or aerial imagery to count populations or identify buildings affected by floods.

The objective of this competition is to create a machine-learning algorithm that counts the number of grass-thatch, tin and other roofed houses in aerial (drone) imagery. Ensuring more accurate estimates of affected populations in the case of a disaster allows these communities to be evacuated or for aid to be provided more effectively, helping to improve response times and save lives in rural Malawi.</p>
